Basic info on how to use this file:

1. Lock your phpBB 3 board
2. Make a full DB backup of your phpBB 3
3. Install Icy Phoenix on the same DB, but with different table prefix (best would be to have Icy Phoenix tables with "ip_" prefix and phpBB 3 tables with "phpbb_" prefix)
4. Edit the constant in "phpbb3_to_ip.php" file to reflect the correct prefix and name in case you need it
5. Upload "phpbb3_to_ip.php" to your Icy Phoenix root and launch it
6. When the conversion ends, you should have all users, forums, topics and posts in your Icy Phoenix DB
